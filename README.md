# CS320 Software Testing Automation and Quality Assurance
Apply software engineering testing strategies and practices as part of the software development lifecycle, including requirements analysis, verification and validation, and quality management. 

# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Testing plays a big role in ensuring that my code, program, or software is functional and secure. Tests need to be properly designed. One type of test is called white-box testing, which is a software testing technique in which internal structure, design, and coding of software are tested to verify flow of input-output and to improve design, usability, and security. Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application without peering into its internal structure.

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Tests can be used to ensure that use cases meet the requirements of the user needs. User needs are should be looked at as software requirements and code design should be completed around those software requirements.  

# How do I approach designing software?
Developers should approach designing software around users needs which should be used as software requirements. Software testing needs to be at the forefront when analyzing and designing code. As I learned during this course, code should be developed with testing in mind.
